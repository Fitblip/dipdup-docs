# dipdup init

Generates type classes and handler templates based on the DipDup configuration file. This is an idempotent command meaning that it won't overwrite previously generated files and you can call it as many times as you want.

```text
dipdup [-c path-to-config.yml] init
```

DipDup will generate all the necessary folders and files containing type definitions and code templates that are to be filled by the developer. See [package](../config-file-reference/package.md#package-structure) docs to learn about the project structure.

## Type classes

DipDup receives all smart contract data \(transaction parameters, resulting storage, Big\_map updates\) already in normalised form \([read more](https://baking-bad.org/blog/2021/03/03/tzkt-v14-released-with-improved-smart-contract-data-and-websocket-api/) about how TzKT handles Michelson expressions\), but still as raw JSON. In order for the developer to work with typed data, DipDup uses contract type information to automatically generate data classes.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
In Python DipDup generates [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/datamodel_code_generator/) models out of JSONSchema.  
You might need to install additional [plugins](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/pycharm_plugin/) for your IDE for convenient work with Pydantic
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

DipDup generates only necessary models:

* For **operation index** it will generate storage type classes for all contracts met in handler patterns plus parameter type classes for all destination+entrypoint pairs.

### Naming

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
In Python all file names are forcibly converted to snake case and all class names â€” to capitalized camel case.

```python
from <package>.types.<typename>.storage import TypeNameStorage
from <package>.types.<typename>.parameter.<entry_point> import (
    EntryPointParameter
)
```

where `typename` is defined in the contract inventory, and `entrypoint` is specified in the handler pattern. **NOTE** the "Storage" and "Parameter" affixes.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

DipDup does not automatically handle name collisions, please use type aliases in case multiple contracts have entrypoints that share the same name.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
from <package>.types.<typename>.parameter.<entry_point> import (
    EntryPointParameter as Alias
)
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Handlers

DipDup generates a separate file with handler method stub for each callback in every index specified in configuration file.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
Callback method signature is the following:

```python
from <package>.types.<typename>.parameter.<entry_point_1> import (
    EntryPoint1Parameter
)
from <package>.types.<typename>.parameter.<entry_point_n> import (
    EntryPointNParameter
)
from <package>.types.<typename>.storage import TypeNameStorage


async def callback(
    ctx: HandlerContext,
    entry_point_1: OperationContext[EntryPoint1Parameter, TypeNameStorage],
    entry_point_n: OperationContext[EntryPointNParameter, TypeNameStorage]
) -> None:
    ...
```

where:

*  `entry_point_1 ... entry_point_n` are items from the according handler pattern.
* `ctx: HandlerContext` contains all the operations \(both external and internal\) matched in a particular operation group content.
* `OperationContext` contains transaction amount, parameter, and storage \(all typed\).

**NOTE** that you can safely change argument names \(e.g. in case of collisions\).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use index templates your callback methods will be reused for potentially different contract addresses. DipDup checks that all those contracts have the same **`typename`** and raises an error otherwise.
{% endhint %}

### Rollback

There is a special handler DipDup generates for all indexes. It tells DipDip how to handle chain reorgs, which is a purely application-specific logic especially if there are stateful entities. The default implementation does nothing if rollback size is 1 block and full reindexing otherwise.

{% page-ref page="../advanced/chain-reorgs.md" %}

## Models

In addition to types and handlers, DipDup also generates `models` file on the top level of the package that will contain all the database models. Models file name and location are restricted by the framework and cannot be changed.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
Python SDK uses Tortoise ORM for working with the database. The expected `models.py` file looks like the following:

```python
from tortoise import Model, fields


class ExampleModel(Model):
    id = fields.IntField(pk=True)
    ...
```
