# DipDup

DipDup is a Python framework for building indexers of Tezos smart-contracts. It helps developers to abstract from data storing and serving workflow and focus on the business logic only. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster indexing times and decreased load on APIs DipDup depends on.
